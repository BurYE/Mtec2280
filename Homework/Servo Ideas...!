Making physical targets for the servo to hit and score points.. like a game-ish
Having the servo respond to certain voice commands to perform a specific action.
Programming the servo to play a game, a simple tapping game like for a phone or tablet or something.. a rythmic game where the servo can
tap a screen to play. Like flappy birds. There's also this game called Stack that has a certain pattern to it.. maybe get the servo to tap the
screen to that pattern to get a hiiiigh score.
